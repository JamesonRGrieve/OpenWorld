**Things to know before using**
- To host a private server, you will need to forward a dedicated port for your server to comunicate using TCP protocol! I can't guide everyone on how to do this as it varies per internet provider / router. So you might need to follow a tutorial to achieve it.
- To enable "Core" or any of the DLCs, download the files from the "Server Extras" folder located at the top of the project files
